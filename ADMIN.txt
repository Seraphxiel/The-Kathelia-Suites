ADMIN
1. Booking Approvals (admin/bookings.php)
New booking arrives

When a guest submits a reservation, it’s inserted into bookings with status = 'pending' and no payment yet.

Admin reviews on “Bookings” page

You see all status = 'pending' rows, with columns:
#, Name, Room, Guest, In, Out, Amenities, Extras, Total (50%), Booking Status (pending), Payment (None)

Actions:

Approve → sets booking.status = 'approved'

Reject → sets booking.status = 'rejected' (or deletes)

Result:

Approved bookings now enter the next stage; rejected ones stop here.

2. Payment Verifications (admin/payments.php)
Guest submits proof

After approval, the guest uploads payment proof. A payments record is created with status = 'submitted'.

Admin checks on “Payments” page

You see only bookings where booking.status = 'approved' and payment.status = 'submitted', with columns:
#, Name, Room, In, Out, Ref #, Proof, Total, Action

Actions:

Verify → sets payment.status = 'verified'

Reject → sets payment.status = 'rejected'

Result:

Verified payments move on to the final “completed” list; rejected ones leave the booking in limbo until the guest re-submits or you cancel the booking.

3. Completed Reservations Dashboard (admin/dashboard.php)
Only fully done

This page pulls only rows where booking.status = 'approved' and payment.status = 'verified'.

What you see:

Metrics cards:

Total Bookings: count of approved reservations

Pending Approvals: count of still-pending reservations

Total Revenue: sum of (nights × rate) + extras for all verified bookings

Table columns:
Reserv. #, Name, Room, Guest, In, Out, Ref #, Total

End state:

Once a payment is verified, that reservation is permanently listed here as a “Completed Reservation,” included in your revenue stats, and no further admin action is needed.
